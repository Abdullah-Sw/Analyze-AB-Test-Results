Analyze A/B Test Results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analytics and data scientists. It is really important that I get some practice working with the hard problems of these.

For this project, I will working to understand the results of an A/B test. My goal is to finish the project and understand it to help the company if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
